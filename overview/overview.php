    What is Community Choice Aggregation?
  </div>

  <p>
    <i>Community Choice Aggregation</i> (CCA) is a state-regulated program that addresses a growing demand by Massachusetts electricity consumers to purchase renewable energy at competitive prices.  Also known as <i>Municipal Aggregation</i>, the program authorizes a municipality to negotiate prices and terms with competing electricity suppliers on behalf of the community.  One hundred seventy-five Massachusetts towns and cities already participate in this program today.  Lawrence should, too.
  </p>

  <p>
    CCA offers the following <i>potential</i> benefits to consumers:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Higher percentage of local renewable energy
      </li>
      <li>
        Rate stability
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower rates
      </li>
      <li>
        Trustworthy alternative to scams from third-party suppliers
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Through CCA, Lawrence would be able to purchase energy with a higher renewable content than required by the Massachusetts Renewable Portfolio Standard, in keeping with the town's values as a designated Massachusetts Green Community.
  </p>

  <p>
    The program would give consumers greater control over the price and content of their electricity supply by offering one or more alternatives to <?=NG?> <a href="/?page=basicservice" ><i><?=BS?></i></a>.  It would also allow customers to resume <?=NGBS?> at any time, with no penalty or fee.  For all customers, <?=NG?> would continue to be the distributor and billing agent.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter164/Section134" target="_blank">Massachusetts General Law, M.G.L. c. 164 sec. 134</a>, outlines CCA rules.  To implement CCA in Lawrence, the town must take the following steps:
    <ol>
      <li>
        In City Council, authorize Lawrence to develop an aggregation plan
      </li>
      <li>
        Engage an energy broker to help design the plan
      </li>
      <li>
        Develop the plan in consultation with MA Department of Energy Resources
      </li>
      <li>
        Approve the aggregation plan in City Council
      </li>
      <li>
        Submit the plan to MA Department of Public Utilities for final approval
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

      <i>
        A goal of the aggregation program is to produce savings for customers, but savings cannot be guaranteed compared to the utilityâ€™s <?=BS?> rate, which changes every six months for Residential and Small Business customers and every three months for Large Business customers.
        The aggregation program seeks to provide price stability and average savings over the full term of the program, but because future <?=BS?> rates are not known, there is no guarantee of savings.
